# growme-organic Internship Assignment

My React internship assignment journey culminated in this dynamic Vite application. I explored the power of Vite's lightning-fast development and the versatility of Material-UI to build a user-friendly experience. This project reflects my growth in React, showcasing my ability to manage user data and create intricate UI components.

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Application Configuration

I successfully created a new React application using Typescript and Vite. I configured the application with MUI by following the [MUI getting started guide](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/).

### Task 2: First Page of the Application

The application offers a streamlined user experience. Users provide their name, phone number, and email on the first page. Submitted information is stored locally. To ensure a clear flow, users who haven't completed the form are redirected back when trying to access the second page.

### Task 3: Second Page of the Application (Component 1)

I successfully fetched a list of JSON data from an API. I converted the JSON data into TypeScript models/interfaces and displayed the data in a table using the [MUI Data Grid](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/).

### Task 4: Second Page of the Application (Component 2)

I created a new component to display department and sub-department information. I used the provided JSON data and successfully implemented the expand/collapse functionality for sub-departments. Users can select departments and sub-departments, and the UI handles automatic selection of related items according to the requirements.

## Deployment

I have deployed the completed application to a hosting provider. You can access the deployed application using the following URL: [Deployed Application](insert_deployed_url_here).

## Submission

I have followed the submission steps as instructed:

1. I pushed the code to a GitHub repository: [GitHub Repository](insert_github_url_here).
2. I deployed the application using a hosting provider.
3. Here are the URLs for my submission:
   - GitHub URL: [GitHub Repository](insert_github_url_here)
   - Deployed Application URL: [Deployed Application](insert_deployed_url_here)

## Conclusion

I thoroughly tested the application to ensure its functionality and to fix any potential issues. I focused on code quality, maintained proper file structure, and ensured a high level of attention to detail throughout the project. I hope my submission meets your expectations, and I am eager to receive your feedback.

Thank you for this opportunity, and I look forward to your review!
